# Python Conventions

## - General rules of PEP8:

```
- Beautiful is better than ugly.
- Explicit is better than implicit.
- Simple is better than complex.
- Complex is better than complicated.
- Flat is better than nested.
- Sparse is better than danse.
- Readability counts.
- Special cases are not special enough to break the rules - (Although practicality beats purity).
- Erros should never pass silently - (Unless explicitly silenced).
- In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
- There should be one and preferably only one obvious way to do it - (Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you are Dutch).
- Now is better than never - (Although never is better than *right* now).
- If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea
- If the implementation is easy to explain, it might be a good idea.
- Namespaces are one honking great idea, let's do more of those!
```

## - General rules of coding:

```
- The tab width should be 4.
- Maximum line lenght should be 79.
