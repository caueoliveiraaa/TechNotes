--| CREATING A REPOSITORY |--

# Go to directory where the repository will be created:

  cd /path/to/local/repository

# Add the files you want to send to the repository to the staging area 
using the git add command. To add all the files in
the current directory and its subdirectories:

  git add . 

# Commit the changes to the local repository using the git commit command

  with a commit message:

  git commit -m "Added new files"

# Connect the local repository to the remote GitHub repository using the

  git remote command with the repository URL.

  git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git

OBS: Replace your-username with your GitHub username and your-repository with
the name of the repository you want to send files to.

# Push the changes to the remote repository on GitHub using the git push command:

  git push origin main

OBS: Replace main with the name of the branch you want to push to, if it's not the default main branch.
